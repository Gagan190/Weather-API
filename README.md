# 🌤️ Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to search for current weather information by city name using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🚀 Features

- Search weather by city name
- Displays:
  - City name
  - Temperature (in Celsius)
  - Weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny)
- Handles errors (e.g., city not found)

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The app uses `fetch()` to call the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Weather data is fetched asynchronously and displayed on the page.
- If a city is not found, an error message is shown.
